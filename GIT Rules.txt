A. With Master Branch Only.
1.Add new Code
2. You need to Add and commit your code into your local machine
3. Push the changes to the GIT Hub

B. With Master and Feature Branch
1.We need to follow the practice with both branches as such

i. We are on Master Branch:
ii. We add Code and commit locally
iii. We need to push it ????? (Before that we need to do the git pull so that all the changes from the GITHUB are in sync with the my local code)
iv. Then again we push the changes from my local to the GITHUB. It's a courtesy call to ask everyone to sync their local repositories with the GITHUB)
v.We follow exactly the same principles for any feature branch.

C. Merging
The golden princple is:
1. Make sure that master branch is perfectly in sync with the GITHUB MAster Branch
2. Make sure that the feature branch is perfectly in sync with the GITHUB Feature Branch
if Point 1 and Point 2 are True, only then then checkout master and then merge it.
3. We merge the branch with the master,
4.WE need to push the master branch to the GITHUB again and then send a courtesy email to everyone for syncing of the GITHUB
